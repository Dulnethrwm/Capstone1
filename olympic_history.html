        <h2>The History of the Olympics</h2>

        <h3>Ancient Olympic Games</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>776 BCE:</strong> The first recorded Olympic Games took place at Olympia, in Greece. These Games were part of a religious festival in honor of Zeus, and they featured various athletic competitions that included running, wrestling, and chariot racing.</li>
            <li><strong>490 BCE:</strong> The marathon is said to have its inspiration in the run of Pheidippides, a Greek soldier who ran from the battlefield of Marathon into Athens to announce a victory over the Persians.</li>
            <li><strong>393 CE:</strong> The Olympic Games were banned by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I as part of his campaign to impose Christianity as the state religion; deeming the Games a pagan festival.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Modern Olympic Games</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1896:</strong> The First Modern Olympic Games took place in Athens, Greece, from April 6 to April 15, 1896. This was made possible by the establishment of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by Pierre de Coubertin. There were 14 participating nations and a total of 43 events for the Games.</li>
            <li><strong>1900:</strong> The Olympics took place in Paris, France. For the first time in history, women could take part in the Olympics, although only in certain events.</li>
            <li><strong>1904:</strong> The St. Louis Olympics in the USA were the first Games to feature gold, silver, and bronze medals for the top three finishers in each event.</li>
            <li><strong>1920:</strong> The Antwerp Games in Belgium introduced the Olympic flag with the five interlocking rings, symbolizing the union of the five inhabited continents and the meeting of athletes from around the world.</li>
            <li><strong>1924:</strong> Chamonix, France hosted the first Winter Olympic Games. The winter sports included skiing, ice skating, and ice hockey.</li>
            <li><strong>1936:</strong> The Berlin Olympics in Nazi Germany became notorious due to the exploitation of those Games for propaganda purposes by Adolf Hitler. However, they remain memorable because an African American, Jesse Owens, won four gold medals.</li>
            <li><strong>1940 & 1944:</strong> The Olympic Games did not happen on account of World War II.</li>
            <li><strong>1960:</strong> The Rome Olympics were the first fully covered on television, thus helping the Olympic Games’ popularity across the globe.</li>
            <li><strong>1964:</strong> The Tokyo Olympics marked the very first ever held in Asia and the first to be broadcast live via satellite.</li>
            <li><strong>1972:</strong> The Munich Olympics are unfortunately best remembered for their tragic "Munich Massacre," in which 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage and killed by a Palestinian terrorist group.</li>
            <li><strong>1980 & 1984:</strong> Olympics target of boycotts—first by the United States in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, then by the Soviet Union and its allies in retaliation against the Los Angeles Games.</li>
            <li><strong>1992:</strong> The Barcelona Olympics bore significance in that they were the first Games not to suffer a boycott since 1972, and also the first appearance by a unified team of former Soviet republics.</li>
            <li><strong>2000:</strong> The Sydney Olympics won widespread praise for the conduct of the Games, and one of its most abiding images—that of Cathy Freeman, an Aboriginal Australian, lighting the Olympic cauldron.</li>
            <li><strong>2008:</strong> The Beijing Olympics were notable for their grand opening ceremony and the dominance of athletes like Michael Phelps, who won eight gold medals in swimming.</li>
            <li><strong>2012:</strong> In London, this was the first time every participating country sent a female athlete into competition.</li>
            <li><strong>2016:</strong> The Rio de Janeiro Games were the first to be held in South America. The Games were also notable because of the Refugee Olympic Team, which competed under the Olympic flag.</li>
            <li><strong>2020:</strong> Because of COVID-19, the Tokyo Olympics were moved to 2021. This is the first time that Games have been postponed, never cancelled.</li>
            <li><strong>2024:</strong> The Summer Olympics will take place in Paris, precisely one hundred years since the Games last took place there in 1924.</li>
        </ul>
